# Weather

### By _**Marika Allely and Adam Ross Russell**_

## Description

####This app was built as an exercise for Epicodus and is not meant to be replicated. I'm keeping it here for my own records, and for nostalgia's sake. Feel free to play with it, but be aware that it is not a complete project.

_Weather allows a user to input a location in the form of a city name and state and returns the weather.  The project was put together using node.js, bower, gulp, and the open weather API._
